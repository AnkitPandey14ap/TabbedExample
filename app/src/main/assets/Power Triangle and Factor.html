    As you may have noticed, a digital potentiometer behaves the same as a mechanical potentiometer, except that instead of having a round handle that you can turn, it’s controlled by a digital interface. As a basic test, you can drive MCP41010 with the help of an Arduino UNO and its Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) port. Note that SPI is a “synchronous” serial data bus — data can travel in both directions at the same time. On Arduino Uno (and compatible) boards, the SPI pins used are:
    <br/>
    SS – D10 (you can use other digital pins, but D10 is the default)
    MOSI – D11<br/>
    MISO – D12<br/>
    SCK – D13<br/>

    Just refer to the datasheet and note that to program the digital pot, you have to first send a “command byte” (to tell the chip what to do) and a “data byte” (to tell the chip which value of resistance to set, from 0 to 255). As found in the datasheet, “executing any command is accomplished by setting CS low and then clocking in a command byte followed by a data byte into the 16-bit shift register. The command is executed when CS is raised.” Now prepare your hardware setup as follows!

    In the hardware setup, MCP41010 is connected to the Arduino via the Arduino’s SPI Interface. Potentiometer terminals A (pin 5) and B (pin 7) are connected to the Arduino 5-volt supply (5 V) and Ground (Gnd). The wiper terminal W (pin 6) is connected to the Analog Pin 1 (A1) of the Arduino. The pretty simple sketch (shown below) loaded into the Arduino selects the MCP41010 and cycles through all 256 wiper positions (about 39 Ω per step). The voltage at the analog pin is then read and displayed on the serial monitor.
