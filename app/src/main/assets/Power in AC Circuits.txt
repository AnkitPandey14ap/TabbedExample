            Power in AC Circuits

        <p>
            In a direct current circuit, the power consumed is simply the
            product of the dc voltage times the DC current, VxI and is measured
            in watts. However, we can not calculate it in a similar manner for
            reactive AC circuits.

                Electrical power is the “rate” at which energy is being
                consumed in a circuit and as such all electrical and electronic
                components and devices have a limit to the amount of electrical
                power that they can safely handle. For example, a 1/4 watt
                resistor or a 20 watt amplifier.
            </p>
            <p>
                Electrical power can be time-varying either as a DC quantity or
                as an AC quantity. The amount of power in a circuit at any
                instant of time is called the <em>instantaneous power</em>and
                is given by the well-known relationship of P = VI. So one watt
                (which is the rate of expending energy at one joule per second)
                will be equal to the volt-ampere product of one volt times one
                ampere.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then the power absorbed or supplied by a circuit element is the
                product of the voltage, V across the element, and the current,
                I flowing through it. So if we had a DC circuit with a
                resistance of “R” ohms, the power dissipated by the resistor in
                watts is given by any of the following generalised formulas:

            <p>
                So power within an electrical circuit is only present when both
                the voltage and current are present, that is no open-circuit or
                closed-circuit conditions. Consider the following simple
                example of a standard resistive dc circuit:

            <h2>
                Electrical Power in an AC Circuit
            </h2>
            <p>
                In a DC circuit, the voltages and currents are generally
                constant, that is not varying with time as there is no
                sinusoidal waveform associated with the supply. However in an
                AC circuit, the instantaneous values of the voltage, current
                and therefore power are constantly changing being influenced by
                the supply. So we can not calculate the power in AC circuits in
                the same manner as we can in DC circuits, but we can still say
                that power (p) is equal to the voltage (v) times the amperes
                (i).
            </p>
            <p>
                Another important point is that AC circuits contain reactance,
                so there is a power component as a result of the magnetic
                and/or electric fields created by the components. The result is
                that unlike a purely resistive component, this power is not
                only consumed but instead is stored and then returned back to
                the supply as the sinusoidal waveform goes through one complete
                periodic cycle.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus, the average power absorbed by a circuit is the sum of the
                power stored and the power returned over one complete cycle. So
                a circuits average power consumption will be the average of the
                instantaneous power over one full cycle with the instantaneous
                power, p defined as the multiplication of the instantaneous
                voltage, v by the instantaneous current, i. Note that as the
                sine function is periodic and continuous, the average power
                given over all time will be exactly the same as the average
                power given over a single cycle.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let us assume that the waveforms of the voltage and current are
                both sinusoidal, so we recall that:

                This equation shows us that the instantaneous AC power has two
                different parts and is therefore the sum of these two terms.
                The second term is a time varying sinusoid whose frequency is
                equal to twice the angular frequency of the supply due to the
                2ω part of the term. The first term however is a constant whose
                value depends only on the phase difference, θ between the
                voltage, (V) and the current, (I).
            </p>
            <p>
                As the instantaneous power is constantly changing with the
                profile of the sinusoid over time, this makes it difficult to
                measure. It is therefore more convenient, and easier on the
                maths to use the average or mean value of the power. So over a
                fixed number of cycles, the average value of the instantaneous
                power of the sinusoid is given simply as:

                When a pure resistor is connected to a sinusoidal voltage
                supply, the current flowing through the resistor will vary in
                proportion to the supply voltage, that is the voltage and
                current waveforms are “in-phase” with each other. Since the
                phase difference between the voltage waveform and the current
                waveform is 0o, the phase angle resulting in cos 0o will be
                equal to 1.

                AC Power in a Purely Inductive Circuit
            </h2>
            <p>
                In a purely inductive (that is infinite capacitance, C = ∞ and
                zero resistance, R = 0) circuit of L henries, the voltage and
                current waveforms are not in-phase. Whenever a changing voltage
                is applied to a purely inductive coil, a “back” emf is produced
                by the coil due to its self-inductance. This self-inductance
                opposes and limits any changes to the current flowing in the
                coil.
            </p>
            <p>
                The effects of this back emf is that the current cannot
                increase immediately through the coil in-phase with the applied
                voltage causing the current waveform to reach its peak or
                maximum value some time after that of the voltage. The result
                is that in a purely inductive circuit, the current always
                “lags” (ELI) behind the voltage by 90o (π/2) as shown.

                The waveforms above shows us the instantaneous voltage and
                instantaneous current across a purely inductive coil as a
                function of time. Maximum current, Im occurs at one full
                quarter of a cycle (90o) after the maximum (peak) value of the
                voltage. Here the current is shown with its negative maximum
                value at the start of the voltage cycle and passes through zero
                increasing to its positive maximum value when the voltage
                waveform is at its maximum value at 90o.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus as the voltage and current waveforms are no longer rising
                and falling together, but instead a phase shift of 90o (π/2) is
                introduced in the coil, then the voltage and current waveforms
                are “out-of-phase” with each other as the voltage leads the
                current by 90o. Since the phase difference between the voltage
                waveform and the current waveform is 90o, then the phase angle
                resulting in cos 90o = 0.

                Clearly then, a pure inductor does not consume or dissipate any
                real or true power, but as we have both voltage and current the
                use of cosθ in the expression: P = IVcosθ for a pure inductor
                is no longer valid. The product of the current and the voltage
                in this case is imaginary power, commonly called “Reactive
                Power”, (Q) measured in voltamperes reactive, (VAr),
                Kilo-voltamperes reactive (KVAr), etc.

                In the positive half of the voltage waveform between the angle
                of 0o and 90o, the inductor current is negative while the
                supply voltage is positive. Therefore, the volts and ampere
                product gives a negative power as a negative times a positive
                equals a negative. Between 90o and 180o, both current and
                voltage waveforms are positive in value resulting in positive
                power. This positive power indicates that the coil is consuming
                electrical energy from the supply.

                In the negative half of the voltage waveform between 180o and
                270o, there is a negative voltage and positive current
                indicating a negative power. This negative power indicates that
                the coil is returning the stored electrical energy back to the
                supply. Between 270oand 360o, both the inductors current and
                the supply voltage are both negative resulting in a period of
                positive power.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then during one full-cycle of the voltage waveform we have two
                identical positive and negative pulses of power whose average
                value is zero so no real power is used up since the power
                alternately flows to and from the source. This means then that
                the total power taken by a pure inductor over one full-cycle is
                zero, so an inductors reactive power does not perform any real
                work.

                A purely capacitive (that is zero inductance, L = 0 and
                infinite resistance, R = ∞) circuit of C Farads, has the
                property of delaying changes in the voltage across it.
                Capacitors store electrical energy in the form of an electric
                field within the dielectric so a pure capacitor does not
                dissipate any energy but instead stores it.

            <p>
                In a purely capacitive circuit the voltage cannot increase
                in-phase with the current as it needs to “charge-up” the
                capacitors plates first. This causes the voltage waveform to
                reach its peak or maximum value some time after that of the

                average value is zero. Thus the power delivered from the source
                to the capacitor is exactly equal to the power returned to the
                source by the capacitor so no real power is used up since the
                power alternately flows to and from the source. This means then
                that the total power taken by a pure capacitor over one
                full-cycle is zero, so the capacitors reactive power does not
                perform any real work.

                AC Electrical Power Summary
            </h2>
            <p>
                We have seen here that in AC circuits, the voltage and current
                flowing in a purely passive circuit are normally out-of-phase
                and, as a result, they can not be used to accomplish any real
                work. We have also seen that in a direct current (DC) circuit,
                electrical power is equal to the voltage times the current, or
                P = VxI, but we can not calculate it in the same manner as for
                AC circuits as we need to take into account any phase
                difference.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a purely resistive circuit, the current and voltage are both
                in-phase and all the electrical power is consumed by the
                resistance, usually as heat. As a result, none of the
                electrical power is returned back to the source supply or
                circuit.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, in a purely inductive or a purely capacitive circuit
                that contains reactance, (X) the current will lead or lag the
                voltage by exactly 90o (the phase angle) so power is both
                consumed and returned back to the source with the average power
                calculated over one full periodic cycle being equal to zero.
            </p>
            <p>
                The electrical power consumed by a resistance, (R) is called
                the true or real power and is simply obtained by multiplying
                the rms voltage with the rms current. The power consumed by a
                reactance, (X) is called the reactive power and is obtained by
                multiplying the voltage, current, and the sine of the phase
                angle between them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The symbol for phase angle is θ (Theta) and which represents
                the inefficiency of the AC circuit with regards to the total
                reactive impedance (Z) that opposes the flow of current in the
                circuit.
