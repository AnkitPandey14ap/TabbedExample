            Reactive Power
        </h1>
        <p>
            Reactive Power can best be described as the quantity of “unused”
            power that is developed by reactive components, such as inductors
            or capacitors in an AC circuit or system. In a DC circuit, the
            product of “volts x amps” gives the power consumed in watts by the
            circuit.

                However, while this formula is also true for purely resistive
                AC circuits, the situation is slightly more complex in an AC
                circuits containing reactive components as this volt-amp
                product can change with frequency.
            </p>
            <p>
                In an AC circuit, the product of voltage and current is
                expressed as volt-amperes (VA) or kilo volt-amperes (kVA) and
                is known as <em>Apparent power</em>, symbol S. In a
                non-inductive purely resistive circuit such as heaters, irons,
                kettles and filament bulbs etc, their reactance is practically
                zero, so the impedance of the circuit is composed almost
                entirely of just resistance.
            </p>
            <p>
                For an AC resistive circuit, the current and voltage are
                in-phase and the power at any instant can be found by
                multiplying the voltage by the current at that instant, and
                because of this “in-phase” relationship, the rms values can be
                used to find the equivalent DC power or heating effect.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, if the circuit contains reactive components, the
                voltage and current waveforms will be “out-of-phase” by some
                amount determined by the circuits phase angle. If the phase
                angle between the voltage and the current is at its maximum of
                90o, the volt-amp product will have equal positive and negative
                values.
            </p>
            <p>
                In other words, the reactive circuit returns as much power to
                the supply as it consumes resulting in the average power
                consumed by the circuit being zero, as the same amount of
                energy keeps flowing alternately from source to the load and
                back from load to source.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since we have a voltage and a current but no power dissipated,
                the expression of P = IV (rms) is no longer valid and it
                therefore follows that the volt-amp product in an AC circuit
                does not necessarily give the power consumed. Then in order to
                determine the “real power”, also called <em>Active power</em>,
                symbol P consumed by an AC circuit, we need to account for not
                only the volt-amp product but also the phase angle difference
                between the voltage and the current waveforms given by the
                equation: VI.cosΦ.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then we can write the relationship between the apparent power
                and active or real power as:

                Note that power factor (PF) is defined as the ratio between the
                active power in watts and the apparent power in volt-amperes
                and indicates how effectively electrical power is being used.
                In a non-inductive resistive AC circuit, the active power will
                be equal to the apparent power as the fraction of P/S becomes
                equal to one or unity. A circuits power factor can be expressed
                either as a decimal value or as a percentage.
            </p>
            <p>
                But as well as the active and apparent powers in AC circuits,
                there is also another power component that is present whenever
                there is a phase angle. This component is called Reactive Power
                (sometimes referred to as imaginary power) and is expressed in
                a unit called “volt-amperes reactive”, (VAr), symbol Q and is
                given by the equation: VI.sinΦ.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reactive power, or VAr, is not really power at all but
                represents the product of volts and amperes that are
                out-of-phase with each other. Reactive power is the portion of
                electricity that helps establish and sustain the electric and
                magnetic fields required by alternating current equipment. The
                amount of reactive power present in an AC circuit will depend
                upon the phase shift or phase angle between the voltage and the
                current and just like active power, reactive power is positive
                when it is “supplied” and negative when it is “consumed”.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reactive power is used by most types of electrical equipment
                that uses a magnetic field, such as motors, generators and
                transformers. It is also required to supply the reactive losses
                on overhead power transmission lines.
            </p>
            <p>
                The relationship of the three elements of power, active power,
                (watts) apparent power, (VA) and reactive power, (VAr) in an AC
                circuit can be represented by the three sides of right-angled
                triangle. This representation is called a Power Triangle as
                shown:
            </p>
            <h3>
                Power in an AC Circuit
            </h3>

            </p>
            <div>
            </div>
            <p>
                From the above power triangle we can see that AC circuits
                supply or consume two kinds of power: active power and reactive
                power. Also, active power is never negative, whereas reactive
                power can be either positive or negative in value so it is
                always advantageous to reduce reactive power in order to
                improve system efficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main advantage of using AC electrical power distribution is
                that the supply voltage level can be changed using
                transformers, but transformers and induction motors of
                household appliances, air conditioners and industrial equipment
                all consume reactive power which takes up space on the
                transmission lines since larger conductors and transformers are
                required to handle the larger currents which you need to pay
                for.

                    Reactive Power Analogy with Beer
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                In many ways, reactive power can be thought of like the foam
                head on a pint or glass of beer. You pay the barman for a full
                glass of beer but only drink the actual liquid beer which is
                always less than a full glass.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is because the head (or froth) of the beer takes up
                additional wasted space in the glass leaving less room for the
                real beer that you consume, and the same idea is true for
                reactive power.
            </p>
            <p>
                But for many industrial power applications, reactive power is
                often useful for an electrical circuit to have. While the real
                or active power is the energy supplied to run a motor, heat a
                home, or illuminate an electric light bulb, reactive power
                provides the important function of regulating the voltage
                thereby helping to move power effectively through the utility
                grid and transmission lines to where it is required by the
                load.
            </p>
            <p>
                While reducing reactive power to help improve the power factor
                and system efficiency is a good thing, one of the disadvantages
                of reactive power is that a sufficient quantity of it is
                required to control the voltage and overcome the losses in a
                transmission network. This is because if the electrical network
                voltage is not high enough, active power cannot be supplied.
                But having too much reactive power flowing around in the
                network can cause excess heating (I2R losses) and undesirable
                voltage drops and loss of power along the transmission lines.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Power Factor Correction of Reactive Power
            </h2>
            <p>
                One way to avoid reactive power charges, is to install power
                factor correction capacitors. Normally residential customers
                are charged only for the active power consumed in kilo-watt
                hours (kWhr) because nearly all residential and single phase
                power factor values are essentially the same due to power
                factor correction capacitors being built into most domestic
                appliances by the manufacturer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Industrial customers, on the other hand, which use 3-phase
                supplies have widely different power factors, and for this
                reason, the electrical utility may have to take the power
                factors of these industrial customers into account paying a
                penalty if their power factor drops below a prescribed value
                because it costs the utility companies more to supply
                industrial customers since larger conductors, larger
                transformers, larger switchgear, etc, is required to handle the
                larger currents.
            </p>
            <p>
                Generally, for a load with a power factor of less than 0.95
                more reactive power is required. For a load with a power factor
                value higher than 0.95 is considered good as the power is being
                consumed more effectively, and a load with a power factor of
                1.0 or unity is considered perfect and does not use any
                reactive power.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then we have seen that “apparent power” is a combination of
                both “reactive power” and “active power”. Active or real power
                is a result of a circuit containing resistive components only,
                while reactive power results from a circuit containing either
                capacitive and inductive components. Almost all AC circuits
                will contain a combination of these R, L and C components.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since reactive power takes away from the active power, it must
                be considered in an electrical system to ensure that the
                apparent power supplied is sufficient to supply the load. This
                is a critical aspect of understanding AC power sources because
                the power source must be capable of supplying the necessary
                volt-amp (VA) power for any given load.
