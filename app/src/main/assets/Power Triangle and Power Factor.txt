                that AC circuits which contain resistance and capacitance or
                resistance and inductance, or both, also contain real power and
                reactive power. So in order for us to calculate the total power
                consumed, we need to know the phase difference between the
                sinusoidal waveforms of the voltage and current.
            </p>
            <p>
                In an AC circuit, the voltage and current waveforms are
                sinusoidal so their amplitudes are constantly changing over
                time. Since we know that power is voltage times the current (P
                = V*I), maximum power will occur when the two voltage and
                current waveforms are lined up with each other. That is, their
                peaks and zero crossover points occur at the same time. When
                this happens the two waveforms are said to be “in-phase”.
            </p>
            <p>
                The three main components in an AC circuit which can affect the
                relationship between the voltage and current waveforms, and
                therefore their phase difference, by defining the total
                impedance of the circuit are the resistor, the capacitor and
                the inductor.
            </p>
            <p>
                The impedance, (Z) of an AC circuit is equivalent to the
                resistance calculated in DC circuits, with impedance given in
                ohms. For AC circuits, impedance is generally defined as the
                ratio of the voltage and current phasor’s produced by a circuit
                component. Phasor’s are straight lines drawn in such a way as
                to represents a voltage or current amplitude by its length and
                its phase difference with respect to other phasor lines by its
                angular position relative to the other phasor’s.
            </p>
            <p>
                AC circuits contain both resistance and reactance that are
                combined together to give a total impedance (Z) that limits
                current flow around the circuit. But an AC circuits impedance
                is not equal to the algebraic sum of the resistive and reactive
                ohmic values as a pure resistance and pure reactance are 90o
                out-of-phase with each other. But we can use this 90o phase
                difference as the sides of a right angled triangle, called an
                impedance triangle, with the impedance being the hypotenuse as
                determined by Pythagoras theorem.
            </p>
            <p>
                This geometric relationship between resistance, reactance and
                impedance can be represented visually by the use of an
                impedance triangle as shown.

                Note that impedance, which is the vector sum of the resistance
                and reactance, has not only a magnitude (Z) but it also has a
                phase angle (θ), which represents the phase difference between
                the resistance and the reactance. Also note that the triangle
                will change shape due to variations in reactance, (X) as the
                frequency changes. Of course, resistance (R) will always remain
                constant.
            </p>
            <p>
                We can take this idea one step further by converting the
                impedance triangle into a power triangle representing the three
                elements of power in an AC circuit. Ohms Law tells us that in a
                DC circuit, power (P), in watts, is equal to the current
                squared (I2) times the resistance (R). So we can multiply the
                three sides of our impedance triangle above by I2 to obtain the
                corresponding power triangle as:

            <p>
                Real power P, also known as true or active power, performs the
                “real work” within an electrical circuit. Real power, measured
                in watts, defines the power consumed by the resistive part of a
                circuit. Then real power, P in an AC circuit is the same as
                power, P in a DC circuit. So just like DC circuits, it is
                always calculated as I2R, where R is the total resistive
                component of the circuit.

                As resistances do not produce any phasor difference (phase
                shift) between voltage and current waveforms, all the useful
                power is delivered directly to the resistance and converted to
                heat, light and work. Then the power consumed by a resistance
                is real power which is fundamentally the circuits average
                power.
            </p>
            <p>
                To find the corresponding value of the real power the rms
                voltage and current values are multiplied by the cosine of the
                phase angle, θ as shown.

            </h2>
            <p>
                Reactive power Q, (sometimes called wattless power) is the
                power consumed in an AC circuit that does not perform any
                useful work but has a big effect on the phase shift between the
                voltage and current waveforms. Reactive power is linked to the
                reactance produced by inductors and capacitors and counteracts
                the effects of real power. Reactive power does not exist in DC
                circuits.

                Unlike real power (P) which does all the work, reactive power
                (Q) takes power away from a circuit due to the creation and
                reduction of both inductive magnetic fields and capacitive
                electrostatic fields, thereby making it harder for the true
                power to supply power directly to a circuit or load.
            </p>
            <p>
                The power stored by an inductor in its magnetic field tries to
                control the current, while the power stored by a capacitors
                electrostatic field tries to control the voltage. The result is
                that capacitors “generate” reactive power and inductors
                “consume” reactive power. This means that they both consume and
                return power to the source so none of the real power is
                consumed.
            </p>
            <p>
                To find reactive power, the rms voltage and current values are
                multiplied by the sine of the phase angle, θ as shown.

            </p>
            <p>
                Then reactive power represents the product of volts and amperes
                that are 90o out-of-phase with each other, but in general,
                there can be any phase angle, θ between the voltage and the

            <p>
                We have seen above that real power is dissipated by resistance
                and that reactive power is supplied to a reactance. As a result
                of this the current and voltage waveforms are not in-phase due
                to the difference between a circuits resistive and reactive
                components.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then there is a mathematical relationship between the real
                power (P), and the reactive power (Q), called the complex
                power. The product of the rms voltage, V applied to an AC
                circuit and the rms current, I flowing into that circuit is
                called the “volt-ampere product” (VA) given the symbol S and
                whose magnitude is known generally as apparent power.
            </p>
            <p>
                This complex Power is not equal to the algebraic sum of the
                real and reactive powers added together, but is instead the
                vector sum of P and Q given in volt-amps (VA). It is complex
                power that is represented by the power triangle. The rms value
                of the volt-ampere product is known more commonly as the
                apparent power as, “apparently” this is the total power
                consumed by a circuit even though the real power that does the
                work is a lot less.
            </p>
            <p>
                As apparent power is made up of two parts, the resistive power
                which is the in-phase power or real power in watts and the
                reactive power which is the out-of-phase power in volt-amperes,
                we can show the vector addition of these two power components
                in the form of a power triangle. A power triangle has four
                parts: P, Q, S and θ.
            </p>
            <p>
                The three elements which make up power in an AC circuit can be

                Power Factor in AC Circuits
            </h2>
            <p>
                Power factor, cosθ, is an important part of an AC circuit that
                can also be expressed in terms of circuit impedance or circuit
                power. Power factor is defined as the ratio of real power (P)
                to apparent power (S), and is generally expressed as either a
                decimal value, for example 0.95, or as a percentage: 95%.
            </p>
            <p>
                Power factor defines the phase angle between the current and
                voltage waveforms, were I and V are the magnitudes of rms
                values of the current and voltage. Note that it does not matter
                whether the phase angle is the difference of the current with
                respect to the voltage, or the voltage with respect to the
                current. The mathematical relationship is given as:

            <p>
                We said previously that in a pure resistive circuit, the
                current and voltage waveforms are in-phase with each other so
                the real power consumed is the same as the apparent power as
                the phase difference is zero degrees (0o). So the power factor
                will be:
            </p>
            <div>
            </div>
            <p>
                Power Factor, pf = cos 0o = 1.0
            </p>
            <div>
            </div>
            <p>
                That is the number of watts consumed is the same as the number
                of volt-amperes consumed producing a power factor of 1.0, or
                100%. In this case it is referred to a unity power factor.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also said above that in a purely reactive circuit, the
                current and voltage waveforms are out-of-phase with each other
                by 90o. As the phase difference is ninety degrees (90o), the
                power factor will be:
            </p>
            <div>
            </div>
            <p>
                Power Factor, pf = cos 90o = 0
            </p>
            <div>
            </div>
            <p>
                That is the number of watts consumed is zero but there is still
                a voltage and current supplying the reactive load. Clearly then
                reducing the reactive VAr component of the power triangle will
                cause θ to reduce improving the power factor towards one,
                unity. It is also desirable to have a high power factor as this
                makes the most efficient use of the circuit delivering current
                to a load.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then we can write the relationship between the real power, the
                apparent power and the circuits power factor as:

                As the power triangle relationships of this simple example
                demonstrates, at 0.5263 or 52.63% power factor, the coil
                requires 150 VA of power to produce 79 Watts of useful work. In
                other words, at 52.63% power factor, the coil takes about 88%
                more current to do the same work, which is a lot of wasted
                current.
            </p>
            <p>
                Adding a power factor correction capacitor (for this example a
                32.3uF) across the coil, in order to increase the power factor
                to over 0.95, or 95%, would greatly reduce the reactive power
                consumed by the coil as these capacitors act as reactive
                current generators, thus reducing the total amount of current
                consumed.

            <h2>
                Power Triangle and Power Factor Summary
            </h2>
            <p>
We have seen here that the three elements of electrical power,<em>Real Power</em>, <em>Reactive Power</em> and                <em>Apparent Power</em> in an AC circuit can be represented by
                the three sides of a triangle called a Power Triangle. As these
                three elements are represented by a “right-angled triangle”,
                their relationship can be defined as: S2 = P2 + Q2, where P is
                the real power in watts (W), Q is the reactive power in
                volt-amperes reactive (VAr) and S is the apparent power in
                volt-amperes (VA).
            </p>
            <p>
                We have also seen that in an AC circuit, the quantity cosθ is
                called the power factor. The power factor of an AC circuit is
                defined as the ratio of the real power (W) consumed by a
                circuit to the apparent power (VA) consumed by the same
                circuit. This therefore gives us: Power Factor = Real
                Power/Apparent Power, or pf = W/VA.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then the cosine of the resulting angle between the current and
                voltage is the power factor. Generally power factor is
                expressed as a percentage, for example 95%, but can also be
                expressed as a decimal value, for example 0.95.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the power factor equals 1.0 (unity) or 100%, that is when
                the real power consumed equals the circuits apparent power, the
                phase angle between the current and the voltage is 0o as:
                cos-1(1.0) = 0o. When the power factor equals zero (0), the
                phase angle between the current and the voltage will be 90o as:
                cos-1(0) = 90o. In this case the actual power consumed by the
                AC circuit is zero regardless of the circuit current.
            </p>
            <p>
                In practical AC circuits, the power factor can be anywhere
                between 0 and 1.0 depending on the passive components within
                the connected load. For an inductive-resistive load or circuit
                (which is most often the case) the power factor will be
                “lagging”. In a capacitive-resistive circuit the power factor
                will be “leading”. Then an AC circuit can be defined to have a
                unity, lagging, or leading power factor.
            </p>
            <p>
                A poor power factor with a value towards zero (0) will consume
                wasted power reducing the efficiency of the circuit, while a
                circuit or load with a power factor closer to one (1.0) or
                unity (100%), will be more efficient. This is because a a
                circuit or load with a low power factor requires more current
                than the same circuit or load with a power factor closer to 1.0
                (unity).
