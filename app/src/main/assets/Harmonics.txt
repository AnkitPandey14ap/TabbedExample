            In an AC circuit, a resistance behaves in exactly the same way as
            it does in a DC circuit. That is, the current flowing through the
            resistance is proportional to the voltage across it.

                This is because a resistor is a linear device and if the
                voltage applied to it is a sine wave, the current flowing
                through it is also a sine wave so the phase difference between
                the two sinusoids is zero.
            </p>
            <p>
                Generally when dealing with alternating voltages and currents
                in electrical circuits it is assumed that they are pure and
                sinusoidal in shape with only one frequency value, called the
                “fundamental frequency” being present, but this is not always
                the case.
            </p>
            <p>
                In an electrical or electronic device or circuit that has a
                voltage-current characteristic which is not linear, that is,
                the current flowing through it is not proportional to the
                applied voltage. The alternating waveforms associated with the
                device will be different to a greater or lesser extent to those
                of an ideal sinusoidal waveform. These types of waveforms are
                commonly referred to as non-sinusoidal or complex waveforms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Complex waveforms are generated by common electrical devices
                such as iron-cored inductors, switching transformers,
                electronic ballasts in fluorescent lights and other such
                heavily inductive loads as well as the output voltage and
                current waveforms of AC alternators, generators and other such
                electrical machines. The result is that the current waveform
                may not be sinusoidal even though the voltage waveform is.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also most electronic power supply switching circuits such as
                rectifiers, silicon controlled rectifier (SCR’s), power
                transistors, power converters and other such solid state
                switches which cut and chop the power supplies sinusoidal
                waveform to control motor power, or to convert the sinusoidal
                AC supply to DC. Theses switching circuits tend to draw current
                only at the peak values of the AC supply and since the
                switching current waveform is non-sinusoidal the resulting load
                current is said to contain Harmonics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Non-sinusoidal complex waveforms are constructed by “adding”
                together a series of sine wave frequencies known as
                “Harmonics”. Harmonics is the generalised term used to describe
                the distortion of a sinusoidal waveform by waveforms of
                different frequencies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then whatever its shape, a complex waveform can be split up
                mathematically into its individual components called the
                fundamental frequency and a number of “harmonic frequencies”.
                But what do we mean by a “fundamental frequency”.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Fundamental Frequency
            </h4>
            <p>
                A Fundamental Waveform (or first harmonic) is the sinusoidal
                waveform that has the supply frequency. The fundamental is the
                lowest or base frequency, ƒ on which the complex waveform is
                built and as such the periodic time, Τ of the resulting complex
                waveform will be equal to the periodic time of the fundamental
                frequency.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let’s consider the basic fundamental or 1st harmonic AC
                waveform as shown.

                Where: Vmax is the peak value in volts and ƒ is the waveforms
                frequency in Hertz (Hz).
            </p>
            <p>
                We can see that a sinusoidal waveform is an alternating voltage
                (or current), which varies as a sine function of angle, 2πƒ.
                The waveforms frequency, ƒ is determined by the number of
                cycles per second. In the United Kingdom this fundamental
                frequency is set at 50Hz while in the United States it is 60Hz.
            </p>
            <p>
                Harmonics are voltages or currents that operate at a frequency
                that is an integer (whole-number) multiple of the fundamental
                frequency. So given a 50Hz fundamental waveform, this means a
                2nd harmonic frequency would be 100Hz (2 x 50Hz), a 3rd
                harmonic would be 150Hz (3 x 50Hz), a 5th at 250Hz, a 7th at
                350Hz and so on. Likewise, given a 60Hz fundamental waveform,
                the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th harmonic frequencies would be at
                120Hz, 180Hz, 240Hz and 300Hz respectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                So in other words, we can say that “harmonics” are multiples of
                the fundamental frequency and can therefore be expressed as:
                2ƒ, 3ƒ, 4ƒ, etc. as shown.

                waveforms as seen by a load due to the harmonic content being
                added to the fundamental frequency.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fundamental waveform can also be called a 1st harmonics
                waveform. Therefore, a second harmonic has a frequency twice
                that of the fundamental, the third harmonic has a frequency
                three times the fundamental and a fourth harmonic has one four
                times the fundamental as shown in the left hand side column.

            <p>
                The right hand side column shows the complex wave shape
                generated as a result of the effect between the addition of the
                fundamental waveform and the harmonic waveforms at different
                harmonic frequencies. Note that the shape of the resulting
                complex waveform will depend not only on the number and
                amplitude of the harmonic frequencies present, but also on the
                phase relationship between the fundamental or base frequency
                and the individual harmonic frequencies.
            </p>
            <p>
                We can see that a complex wave is made up of a fundamental
                waveform plus harmonics, each with its own peak value and phase
                angle. For example, if the fundamental frequency is given as; E
                = Vmax(2πƒt), the values of the harmonics will be given as:
            </p>
            <p>
                For a second harmonic:
            </p>
            <p>
                E2 = V2max(2×2πƒt) = V2max(4πƒt), = V2max(2ωt)
            </p>
            <p>
                For a third harmonic:
            </p>
            <p>
                E3 = V3max(3×2πƒt) = V3max(6πƒt), = V3max(3ωt)
            </p>
            <p>
                For a fourth harmonic:
            </p>
            <p>
                E4 = V4max(4×2πƒt) = V4max(8πƒt), = V4max(4ωt)
            </p>
            <p>
                and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then the equation given for the value of a complex waveform
                will be:

                Harmonics are generally classified by their name and frequency,
                for example, a 2ndharmonic of the fundamental frequency at 100
                Hz, and also by their sequence. Harmonic sequence refers to the
                phasor rotation of the harmonic voltages and currents with
                respect to the fundamental waveform in a balanced, 3-phase
                4-wire system.
            </p>
            <p>
                A positive sequence harmonic ( 4th, 7th, 10th, …) would rotate
                in the same direction (forward) as the fundamental frequency.
                Where as a negative sequence harmonic ( 2nd, 5th, 8th, …)
                rotates in the opposite direction (reverse) of the fundamental
                frequency.
            </p>
            <p>
                Generally, positive sequence harmonics are undesirable because
                they are responsible for overheating of conductors, power lines
                and transformers due to the addition of the waveforms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Negative sequence harmonics on the other hand circulate between
                the phases creating additional problems with motors as the
                opposite phasor rotation weakens the rotating magnetic field
                require by motors, and especially induction motors, causing
                them to produce less mechanical torque.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another set of special harmonics called “triplens” (multiple of
                three) have a zero rotational sequence. <em>Triplens</em> are
                multiples of the third harmonic ( 3rd, 6th, 9th, …), etc, hence
                their name, and are therefore displaced by zero degrees. Zero
                sequence harmonics circulate between the phase and neutral or
                ground.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike the positive and negative sequence harmonic currents
                that cancel each other out, third order or triplen harmonics do
                not cancel out. Instead add up arithmetically in the common
                neutral wire which is subjected to currents from all three
                phases.
            </p>
            <p>
                The result is that current amplitude in the neutral wire due to
                these triplen harmonics could be up to 3 times the amplitude of
                the phase current at the fundamental frequency causing it to
                become less efficient and overheat.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then we can summarise the sequence effects as multiples of the
                fundamental frequency of 50Hz as:

                Harmonics Summary
            </h2>
            <p>
                Harmonics have only been around in sufficient quantities over
                the last few decades since the introduction of electronic
                drives for motors, fans and pumps, power supply switching
                circuits such as rectifiers, power converters and thyristor
                power controllers as well as most non-linear electronic phase
                controlled loads and high frequency (energy saving) fluorescent
                lights. This is due mainly to the fact that the controlled
                current drawn by the load does not faithfully follow the
                sinusoidal supply waveforms as in the case of rectifiers or
                power semiconductor switching circuits.
            </p>
            <p>
                Harmonics in the electrical power distribution system combine
                with the fundamental frequency (50Hz or 60Hz) supply to create
                distortion of the voltage and/or current waveforms. This
                distortion creates a complex waveform made up from a number of
                harmonic frequencies which can have an adverse effect on
                electrical equipment and power lines.
            </p>
            <p>
                The amount of waveform distortion present giving a complex
                waveform its distinctive shape is directly related to the
                frequencies and magnitudes of the most dominant harmonic
                components whose harmonic frequency is multiples (whole
                integers) of the fundamental frequency. The most dominant
                harmonic components are the low order harmonics from 2nd to the
                19th with the triplens being the worst.
