                The three main passive components used in any circuit are the:

                    Resistor
                </a>
                , the
                <a
                    href="http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/capacitor/cap_1.html"
                >
                    Capacitor
                </a>
                and the
                <a

                >
                    Inductor
                </a>
                . All three of these passive components have one thing in
                common, they limit the flow of electrical current through a
                circuit but in very different ways.
            </p>
            <p>
                Electrical current can flow through a circuit in either of two
                ways. If it flows in one steady direction only it is classed as
                direct current, (DC). If the electrical current alternates in
                both directions back and forth it is classed as alternating
                current, (AC). Although they present an impedance within a
                circuit, passive components in AC circuits behave very
                differently to those in DC circuits.
            </p>
            <p>
                Passive components consume electrical energy and therefore can
                not increase or amplify the power of any electrical signals
                applied to them, simply because they are passive and as such
                will always have a gain of less than one. Passive components
                used in electrical and electronic circuits can be connected in
                an infinite number of ways as shown below, with the operation
                of these circuits depending on the interaction between their
                different electrical properties.

            <p>
                Resistors whether used in DC or AC circuits will always have
                the same value of resistance no matter what the supply
                frequency. This is because resistors are classed to be pure
                having parasitic properties such as infinite capacitance C = ∞
                and zero inductance L = 0. Also for a resistive circuit the
                voltage and current are always in-phase so the power consumed
                at any instant can be found by multiplying the voltage by the
                current at that instant.
            </p>
            <p>
                Capacitors and inductors on the other hand, have a different
                type of AC resistance known as <em>reactance</em>, ( XL , XC ).
                Reactance also impedes the flow of current, but the amount of
                reactance is not a fixed quantity for one inductor or capacitor
                in the same way that a resistor has a fixed value of
                resistance. The reactance value of an inductor or a capacitor
                depends upon the frequency of the supply current as well as on
                the DC value of the component itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following is a list of passive components commonly used in
                AC circuits along with their corresponding equations which can
                be used to find their value or circuit current. Note that a
                theoretically perfect (pure) capacitor or inductor does not
                have any resistance. However in the real world they will always
                have some resistive value no matter how small.

            <p>
                Resistor – Resistors regulate, impede or set the flow of
                current through a particular path or impose a voltage reduction
                in an electrical circuit as a result of this current flow.
Resistors have a form of impedance which is simply termed                <em>resistance</em>, ( R ) with the resistive value of a
                resistor being measured in Ohms, Ω. Resistors can be of either
                a fixed value or a variable value (potentiometers).

                Capacitor – The capacitor is a component which has the ability
                or “capacity” to store energy in the form of an electrical
                charge like a small battery. The capacitance value of a
                capacitor is measured in Farads, F. At DC a capacitor has
                infinite (open-circuit) impedance, ( XC ) while at very high
                frequencies a capacitor has zero impedance (short-circuit).

                Inductor – An inductor is a coil of wire that induces a
                magnetic field within itself or within a central core as a
                direct result of current passing through the coil. The
                inductance value of an inductor is measured in Henries, H. At
                DC an inductor has zero impedance (short-circuit), while at
                high frequencies an inductor has infinite (open-circuit)

            <p>
                We have seen above that passive components in AC circuits
                behave very differently than when connected in a DC circuit due
                to the influence of frequency, ( ƒ ). In a purely resistive
                circuit, the current is in-phase with the voltage. In a purely
                capacitive circuit the current in the capacitor leads the
                voltage by 90o and in a purely inductive circuit the current
                lags the voltage by 90o.
            </p>
            <p>
                The opposition to current flow through a passive component in
                an AC circuit is called: resistance, R for a resistor,
                capacitive reactance, XC for a capacitor and inductive
                reactance, XL for an inductor. The combination of resistance
                and reactance is called Impedance.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a series circuit, the phasor sum of the voltages across the
                circuits components is equal to the supply voltage, VS. In a
                parallel circuit, the phasor sum of the currents flowing in
                each branch and therefore through each of the circuits
                components is equal to the supply current, IS.
            </p>
            <p>
                For both parallel and series connected RLC circuits, when the
                supply current is “in-phase” with the supply voltage the
                circuit resonance occurs as XL = XC. A
