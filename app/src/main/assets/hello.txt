    that AC circuits which contain resistance and capacitance or resistance and
    inductance, or both, also contain real power and reactive power. So in
    order for us to calculate the total power consumed, we need to know the
    phase difference between the sinusoidal waveforms of the voltage and
    current.
</p>
<p>
    In an AC circuit, the voltage and current waveforms are sinusoidal so their
    amplitudes are constantly changing over time. Since we know that power is
    voltage times the current (P = V*I), maximum power will occur when the two
    voltage and current waveforms are lined up with each other. That is, their
    peaks and zero crossover points occur at the same time. When this happens
    the two waveforms are said to be “in-phase”.
</p>
<p>
    The three main components in an AC circuit which can affect the
    relationship between the voltage and current waveforms, and therefore their
    phase difference, by defining the total impedance of the circuit are the
    resistor, the capacitor and the inductor.
</p>
<p>
    The impedance, (Z) of an AC circuit is equivalent to the resistance
    calculated in DC circuits, with impedance given in ohms. For AC circuits,
    impedance is generally defined as the ratio of the voltage and current
    phasor’s produced by a circuit component. Phasor’s are straight lines drawn
    in such a way as to represents a voltage or current amplitude by its length
    and its phase difference with respect to other phasor lines by its angular
    position relative to the other phasor’s.
</p>
<p>
    AC circuits contain both resistance and reactance that are combined
    together to give a total impedance (Z) that limits current flow around the
    circuit. But an AC circuits impedance is not equal to the algebraic sum of
    the resistive and reactive ohmic values as a pure resistance and pure
    reactance are 90o out-of-phase with each other. But we can use this 90o
    phase difference as the sides of a right angled triangle, called an
    impedance triangle, with the impedance being the hypotenuse as determined
    by Pythagoras theorem.
</p>
<p>
    This geometric relationship between resistance, reactance and impedance can
    be represented visually by the use of an impedance triangle as shown.

    Note that impedance, which is the vector sum of the resistance and
    reactance, has not only a magnitude (Z) but it also has a phase angle (θ),
    which represents the phase difference between the resistance and the
    reactance. Also note that the triangle will change shape due to variations
    in reactance, (X) as the frequency changes. Of course, resistance (R) will
    always remain constant.
</p>
<p>
    We can take this idea one step further by converting the impedance triangle
    into a power triangle representing the three elements of power in an AC
    circuit. Ohms Law tells us that in a DC circuit, power (P), in watts, is
    equal to the current squared (I2) times the resistance (R). So we can
    multiply the three sides of our impedance triangle above by I2 to obtain
    the corresponding power triangle as:

    Real Power in AC Circuits
</h2>
<p>
    Real power P, also known as true or active power, performs the “real work”
    within an electrical circuit. Real power, measured in watts, defines the
    power consumed by the resistive part of a circuit. Then real power, P in an
    AC circuit is the same as power, P in a DC circuit. So just like DC
    circuits, it is always calculated as I2R, where R is the total resistive
    component of the circuit.

<p>
    As resistances do not produce any phasor difference (phase shift) between
    voltage and current waveforms, all the useful power is delivered directly
    to the resistance and converted to heat, light and work. Then the power
    consumed by a resistance is real power which is fundamentally the circuits
    average power.
</p>
<p>
    To find the corresponding value of the real power the rms voltage and
    current values are multiplied by the cosine of the phase angle, θ as shown.

    But as their is no phase difference between the voltage and the current in
    a resistive circuit, the phase shift between the two waveforms will be zero
    (0). Then:

    Where real power (P) is in watts, voltage (V) is in rms volts and current
    (I) is in rms amperes.
</p>
<p>
    Then real power is the I2R resistive element measured in watts, which is
    what you read on your utility energy meter and has units in Watts (W),
    Kilowatts (kW), and Megawatts (MW). Note that real power, P is always
    positive.
