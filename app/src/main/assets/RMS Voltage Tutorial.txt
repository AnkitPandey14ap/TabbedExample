            we looked briefly at the RMS Voltage value of a sinusoidal waveform
            and said that this RMS value gives the same heating effect as an
            equivalent DC power and in this tutorial we will expand on this
            theory a little more by looking at RMS voltages and currents in
            more detail.

                The term “RMS” stands for “Root-Mean-Squared”. Most books
                define this as the “amount of AC power that produces the same
                heating effect as an equivalent DC power”, or something similar
                along these lines, but an RMS value is more than just that. The
                RMS value is the square root of the mean (average) value of the
                squared function of the instantaneous values. The symbols used
                for defining an RMS value are VRMS or IRMS.
            </p>
            <p>
                The term RMS, ONLY refers to time-varying sinusoidal voltages,
                currents or complex waveforms were the magnitude of the
                waveform changes over time and is not used in DC circuit
                analysis or calculations were the magnitude is always constant.
                When used to compare the equivalent RMS voltage value of an
                alternating sinusoidal waveform that supplies the same
                electrical power to a given load as an equivalent DC circuit,
                the RMS value is called the “effective value” and is generally
                presented as: Veff or Ieff.
            </p>
            <p>
                In other words, the effective value is an equivalent DC value
                which tells you how many volts or amps of DC that a
                time-varying sinusoidal waveform is equal to in terms of its
                ability to produce the same power. For example, the domestic
                mains supply in the United Kingdom is 240Vac. This value is
                assumed to indicate an effective value of “240 Volts rms”. This
                means then that the sinusoidal rms voltage from the wall
                sockets of a UK home is capable of producing the same average
                positive power as 240 volts of steady DC voltage as shown
                below.

                So how do we calculated the RMS Voltage of a sinusoidal
                waveform. The RMS voltage of a sinusoid or complex waveform can
                be determined by two basic methods.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Graphical Method – which can be used to find the RMS value
                    of any non-sinusoidal time-varying waveform by drawing a
                    number of mid-ordinates onto the waveform.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Analytical Method – is a mathematical procedure for finding
                    the effective or RMS value of any periodic voltage or
                    current using calculus.

                RMS Voltage Graphical Method
            </h2>
            <p>
                Whilst the method of calculation is the same for both halves of
                an AC waveform, for this example we will consider only the
                positive half cycle. The effective or rms value of a waveform
                can be found with a reasonable amount of accuracy by taking
                equally spaced instantaneous values along the waveform.
            </p>
            <p>
                The positive half of the waveform is divided up into any number
                of “n” equal portions or <em>mid-ordinates</em> and the more
                mid-ordinates that are drawn along the waveform, the more
                accurate will be the final result. The width of each
                mid-ordinate will therefore be no degrees and the height of
                each mid-ordinate will be equal to the instantaneous value of
                the waveform at that time along the x-axis of the waveform.
            </p>

                Each mid-ordinate value of a waveform (the voltage waveform in
                this case) is multiplied by itself (squared) and added to the
                next. This method gives us the “square” or Squared part of the
                RMS voltage expression. Next this squared value is divided by
                the number of mid-ordinates used to give us the Mean part of
                the RMS voltage expression, and in our simple example above the
                number of mid-ordinates used was twelve (12). Finally, the
                square root of the previous result is found to give us the Root
                part of the RMS voltage.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then we can define the term used to describe an rms voltage
                (VRMS) as being “the square <u>root</u> of the <u>mean</u> of
                the <u>square</u> of the mid-ordinates of the voltage waveform”
                and this is given as:

                calculated as:

            <p>
                The graphical method above is a very good way of finding the
                effective or RMS voltage, (or current) of an alternating
                waveform that is not symmetrical or sinusoidal in nature. In
                other words the waveform shape resembles that of a complex
                waveform. However, when dealing with pure sinusoidal waveforms
                we can make life a little bit easier for ourselves by using an
                analytical or mathematical way of finding the RMS value.
            </p>
            <p>
                A periodic sinusoidal voltage is constant and can be defined as
                V(t) = Vm.cos(ωt) with a period of T. Then we can calculate the
                root-mean-square (rms) value of a sinusoidal voltage (V(t)) as:

                Then the RMS voltage (VRMS) of a sinusoidal waveform is
                determined by multiplying the peak voltage value by 0.7071,
                which is the same as one divided by the square root of two (
                1/√2 ). The RMS voltage, which can also be referred to as the
                effective value, depends on the magnitude of the waveform and
                is not a function of either the waveforms frequency nor its
                phase angle.
            </p>
            <p>
                From the graphical example above, the peak voltage (Vpk) of the
                waveform was given as 20 Volts. By using the analytical method
                just defined we can calculate the RMS voltage as being:
            </p>
            <p>
                VRMS = Vpk x 0.7071 = 20 x 0.7071 = 14.14V
            </p>
            <div>
            </div>
            <p>
                Note that this value of 14.14 volts is the same value as for
                the previous graphical method. Then we can use either the
                graphical method of mid-ordinates, or the analytical method of
                calculation to find the RMS voltage or current values of a
                sinusoidal waveform. Note that multiplying the peak or maximum
                value by the constant 0.7071, ONLY applies to sinusoidal
                waveforms. For non-sinusoidal waveforms the graphical method
                must be used.

                RMS Voltage Summary
            </h2>
            <p>
                Then to summarise. When dealing with alternating voltages (or
                currents) we are faced with the problem of how do we represent
                a voltage or signal magnitude. One easy way is to use the peak
                values for the waveform. Another common method is to use the
                effective value which is also known by its more common
                expression of Root Mean Square or simply the RMS value.
            </p>
            <p>
                The root mean squared, RMS value of a sinusoid is not the same
                as the average of all the instantaneous values. The ratio of
                the RMS value of voltage to the maximum value of voltage is the
                same as the ratio of the RMS value of current to the maximum
                value of current. Most multi-meters, either voltmeters or
                ammeters, measure RMS value assuming a pure sinusoidal
                waveform. For finding the RMS value of non-sinusoidal waveform
                a “True RMS Multimeter” is required.
            </p>
            <p>
                The RMS value of a sinusoidal waveform gives the same heating
                effect as a DC current of the same value. That is if a direct
                current, I passes through a resistance of R ohms, the DC power
                consumed by the resistor as heat will therefore be I2R watts.
                Then if an alternating current, i = Im.sinθ flows through the
                same resistance, the AC power converted into heat will be:
                I2rms.R watts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then when dealing with alternating voltages and currents, they
                should be treated as RMS values unless otherwise stated.
                Therefore an alternating current of 10 amperes will have the
                same heating effect as a direct current of 10 amperes and a
                maximum value of 14.14 amperes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having now determined the RMS value of an alternating voltage
                (or current) waveform, in the next tutorial we will look at
                calculating the
