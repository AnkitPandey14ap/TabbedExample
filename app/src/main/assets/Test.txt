<p>
    Real power P, also known as true or active power, performs the “real work”
    within an electrical circuit. Real power, measured in watts, defines the
    power consumed by the resistive part of a circuit. Then real power, P in an
    AC circuit is the same as power, P in a DC circuit. So just like DC
    circuits, it is always calculated as I2R, where R is the total resistive
    component of the circuit.

<p>
    As resistances do not produce any phasor difference (phase shift) between
    voltage and current waveforms, all the useful power is delivered directly
    to the resistance and converted to heat, light and work. Then the power
    consumed by a resistance is real power which is fund
